    title={Progressive Smoothing for Motion Planning in Real-Time NMPC},
    abstract={Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is a popular strategy for solving motion planning problems appearing in autonomous driving applications that include collision avoidance constraints. Non-smooth obstacle shapes, such as rectangles, introduce additional local minima in the underlying optimization problem. Using smooth over-approximations, e.g., ellipsoidal shapes, limits the performance due to their conservativeness. We propose to vary the smoothness and the related over-approximation by a homotopy. Instead of varying the smoothness in consecutive sequential quadratic programming iterations, we use formulations that decrease the smooth over-approximation from the end towards the beginning of the prediction horizon. Thus, the real-time iteration scheme applies to the proposed NMPC formulation, i.e., only one quadratic program needs to be solved at each time step. Different formulations are compared in simulation experiments and shown to successfully improve performance without increasing the computational burden.},

	abstract = {Mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) are a versatile way of formulating vehicle decision making and motion planning problems, where the prediction model is a hybrid dynamical system that involves both discrete and continuous decision variables. However, even the most advanced MIQP solvers can hardly account for the challenging requirements of automotive embedded platforms. Thus, we use machine learning to simplify and hence speed up optimization. Our work builds on recent ideas for solving MIQPs in real-time by training a neural network to predict the optimal values of integer variables and solving the remaining problem by online quadratic programming. Specifically, we propose a recurrent permutation equivariant deep set that is particularly suited for imitating MIQPs that involve many obstacles, which is often the major source of computational burden in motion planning problems. Our framework comprises also a feasibility projector that corrects infeasible predictions of integer variables and considerably increases the likelihood of computing a collision-free trajectory. We evaluate the performance, safety and real-time feasibility of decision-making for autonomous driving using the proposed approach on realistic multi-lane traffic scenarios with interactive agents in SUMO simulations.},

    year={2024},
    issn = {2379-8904},
    abstract = {This work considers the problem of optimal lane changing in a structured multi-agent road environment. A novel motion planning algorithm that can capture long-horizon dependencies as well as short-horizon dynamics is presented. Pivotal to our approach is a geometric approximation of the long-horizon combinatorial transition problem which we formulate in the continuous time-space domain. Moreover, a discrete-time formulation of a short-horizon optimal motion planning problem is formulated and combined with the long-horizon planner. Both individual problems, as well as their combination, are formulated as mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) and solved in real-time by using state-of-the-art solvers. We show how the presented algorithm outperforms two other state-of-the-art motion planning algorithms in closed-loop performance and computation time in lane changing problems. Evaluations are performed using the traffic simulator SUMO, a custom low-level tracking model predictive controller, and high-fidelity vehicle models and scenarios, provided by the CommonRoad environment.},

	abstract = {In recent years, nonlinear model predictive control has been extensively used for solving automotive motion control and planning tasks. In order to formulate the nonlinear model predictive control problem, different coordinate systems can be used with different advantages. We propose and compare formulations for the nonlinear MPC related optimization problem, involving a Cartesian and a Frenet coordinate frame in a single nonlinear program. We specify costs and collision avoidance constraints in the more advantageous coordinate frame, derive appropriate formulations and compare different obstacle constraints. With this approach, we exploit the simpler formulation of opponent vehicle constraints in the Cartesian coordinate frame, as well as road-aligned costs and constraints related to the Frenet coordinate frame. Comparisons to other approaches in a simulation framework highlight the advantages of the proposed methods.},
